Assertion in Test Ng-


When we are comparing actual result with expected result we use assertion in test ng to mark
test case pass or fail as per result.

Assert is the predefine class in testng.


Thre are two types of assert.

1) Hard assert-

If test case failed during assertion immidiately test case marked as fail teminate exeuction
immidiately, this type assert is called as "Hard Assert".

ex-
 String actualTitle=driver.getTitle();
		String expectedTitle="ExplicitlyWait Practice page in Selenium Webdriver";
		System.out.println(actualTitle);
		if (actualTitle.equals(expectedTitle)) {
		Assert.assertTrue(true);}
		else {
			Assert.assertTrue(false);
		}
		System.out.println("After assert statement");


2) Soft Assert-

When we want to execute below line of code after assert failure then we go for soft Assert.
If soft assert failed it will continue excute below line of code till the end and lastly
it read AssertAll() and mark test case as failed.
To execute test case even if it got failed  nad later mark as fail we use soft assert.


ex-

	  SoftAssert sa=new SoftAssert();
	  
	  String actualTitle=driver.getTitle();
		String expectedTitle="ExplicitfgfgjsdflyWait Practice page in Selenium Webdriver";
		System.out.println(actualTitle);
		if (actualTitle.equals(expectedTitle)) {
		sa.assertTrue(true);}
		else {
			sa.assertTrue(false);
		}
		System.out.println("After assert statement");
		sa.assertAll();
